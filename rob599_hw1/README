I added an rviz default file. I figured this may help
in setting up the visualization.

I don't have other nodes to run my code. I used ther terminal
to call my service and action sever.

 examples:
      rosservice call /stopping_distance 1.5

      rostopic pub /Stop_Action/goalob599_hw1/StopActionGoal "header:
        seq: 0
          stamp:
          secs: 0
          nsecs: 0
          frame_id: ''
          goal_id:
            stamp:
              secs: 0
                nsecs: 0
                id: ''
        goal:
        distance: 1"
